# Image preference classifier
 This web-application learns your image preferences using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
 It's predicting if you'd like an image or not using Knn nearest neighbours

 Lots of stuff to be added. I included a nice 'lil dataset (10,000 image) for you to fool around with, thanks to [these guys](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

 Running this project must happen on a web server, don't have one or too lazy? Use
 [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related) chrome extension to easily create a test environment.
